This will be reached by implementing two use cases based on flexibility : \r
\r
(1)  Concerning dynamic tariff and appliance management use case, the impact is to prove the efficiency of the energy offer and its usage for both the end-users and the different stakeholders. The other impacts are the education of the end-users by the grid stakeholders, raising “energy awareness” of residents, educating them about automatic energy saving and efficiency, and the environmental impact of their consumption habits. After deploying the dynamic tariff’s service, the customers will be aware of price variation intra-day, and the customers will become a significant energy actor. Indeed the customers must be engaged in managing their consumption and flexibility and his bill reduction. Thus, this will favour the energy transition. \r
\r
\r
To maximise RES use case usage, the impact is to prove the viability of a new business model. The end-user is a prosumer, and the town hall/institution is a central component of this energy transformation. The other impact is creating non-energy services in the energy community and showing we can maximise the usage of RES at a local level. It will be the first time that an energy community mixed town hall and citizens and rewards per contribution’s unique level.  \r
At a global level, this will reduce the energy carbon footprint of the end-users. `,"Actual impacts":`The design and implementation of a Smart Orchestrator allow the intelligent and remote control in the same household of different Energy Management Systems (EMSs) provided by various service providers. E.g., the Smart Orchestrator is intelligently controlled by AI. According to user recommendations from both the energy provider one/energy provider two EMS controlling the water heater and the heating and optimising the start-up of whites-goods provided by Whirlpool/Miele/Bosch and the charging of the EV platform. \r
\r
Creation of a power limitation service to prevent the smart meter from tripping (and cutting off the electricity supply) because of different appliances being started by different independent EMSs. Power limitation is an interoperable microservice using cloud and edge computing to stop intelligent devices when the electricity consumption exceeds the maximum power.
