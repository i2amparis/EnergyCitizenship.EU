        <p>ENCLUDE is a Horizon 2020 EU project that aims to help the EU to achieve a just and inclusive decarbonisation by sharing and co-creating new knowledge and practices that maximise the number and diversity of citizens who are willing and able to contribute to the energy transition.<br><br></p>

        <!-- <p> </p>

        <p>We are developing a policy platform that envisions to be the go-to source of information in Europe about citizen engagement in the energy transition. Our aim is to consolidate results from six Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects about citizen engagement in a format that would be useful and usable by policymakers around Europe. <br><br></p>

        <p>Currently, we have created a demo of the platform that provides information about a <em>selection of collective energy initiatives in Europe</em> that we have surveyed and interviewed. The names of the initiatives are currently not provided due to GDPR reasons, but will be availabe in the final version. 
        <br><br></p>

        <p>Feel free to explore and let us know your feedback!<br><br></p>
