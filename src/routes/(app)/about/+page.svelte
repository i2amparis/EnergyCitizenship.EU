      <p class="block antialiased font-sans text-md font-normal leading-relaxed text-inherit mt-2 w-full !text-gray-500">Energy citizenship can relate to both the rights and responsibilities that people have within the energy system. Traditionally, citizens were assumed to be only passive consumers of the system but there are increasingly more modes of participation including in issues related to energy access and production but also in the political and governance aspects of energy. In each of these modes, ENCLUDE researchers have identified multiple expressions of energy citizenship which can be explored by pressing on the icons on this page.</p> 
      <p class="block antialiased font-sans text-md font-normal leading-relaxed text-inherit mt-2 w-full !text-gray-500">More details can be found in <a href="http://encludeproject.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ENCLUDE_D2.2_Typology_of_Energy_Citizenships.pdf">a report by ENCLUDE researchers</a>. Nevertheless, ENCLUDE is not the only project that has explored the energy citizenship concept.
