      <p class="block antialiased font-sans text-md font-normal leading-relaxed text-inherit mt-2 w-full !text-gray-500">Energy citizenship is a term used by activists, academics, and increasingly, policymakers to conceptualise the potential roles that citizens could (or should) play in the energy system. This conceptualisation can be related to both rights and responsibilities that people have related to the energy system.</p> 
      <p class="block antialiased font-sans text-md font-normal leading-relaxed text-inherit mt-2 w-full !text-gray-500">Traditionally, citizens were assumed to be only passive consumers of the system but there are increasingly more modes of participation including in issues related to energy access and production but also in the political and governance aspects of energy. In each of this mode, ENCLUDE researchers have identified multiple expressions of energy citizenship.</p>
