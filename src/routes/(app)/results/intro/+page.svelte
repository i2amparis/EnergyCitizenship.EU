        Combining &ldquo;people-centered&rdquo; with narratives of potential
        &ldquo;future-world&rdquo; evolutions towards transformative scenario
        design and the operationalization of energy citizenship
    </h2>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Since the early 2000s scholars have been increasingly recognizing the <strong
        >limitations</strong
      >
      of <strong>traditional top-down approaches</strong> to climate and energy
      policy, which fail to account for the <strong>social</strong> and
      <strong>cultural</strong>
      dimensions of energy use and production. In this context, the concept of
      <strong>energy citizenship</strong>
      has emerged and gained considerable attention in recent years due to its
      potential to bridge the gap between energy transition policies and social
      participation, by emphasizing the significance of
      <strong>participatory</strong>
      and <strong>democratic</strong> processes in relevant decision-making processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discourse surrounding energy matters has predominantly centered on <u
        >technical</u
      >
      and <u>economic</u> considerations, often overlooking discussions on
      <strong>inclusive</strong>
      and <strong>democratic</strong> <em>governance</em>. This is also reflected
      in contemporary energy <em>modelling practices</em> and
      <em>scenario-based research</em>, where focus is primarily placed on the
      technological optimization and economic implications of the energy
      transition, often disregarding social and environmental aspects, and
      treating them as external narratives, only to be considered &ldquo;<strong
        >on-top</strong
      >&rdquo; of modelling results, serving merely as a perspective for
      discussing scenarios and narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Underrepresentation of such elements combined with disproportionate
      emphasis on technoeconomic factors can lead to <strong
        >oversimplified</strong
      > <strong>scenarios</strong> that fail to inform policymakers about the multiple
      dimensions crucial for achieving a sustainable and inclusive energy transition.
      In this respect, there is a growing body of research seeking ways to integrate
      social sciences into scenario-based exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this end, in ENCLUDE, we developed and applied a novel framework for <strong
        >transformative scenario design</strong
      >
      based on <strong>social innovations</strong> of
      <strong>energy citizenship</strong>
      and potential <strong>evolutions</strong> of the <strong>future</strong>,
      which encompasses a broad spectrum of uncertainties and embraces the depth
      of complexity of the energy landscape, at the <strong>local</strong>, the
      <strong>regional</strong>, the <strong>national</strong>, or the
      <strong>transnational</strong>
      level. The developed framework does not only consider regulatory
      influences and technological advancements, but also delves into the
      social, cultural, and behavioral manifestations of energy citizenship,
      envisioning energy futures that go <strong>beyond</strong> the
      <strong>comfort zone</strong>
      of <strong>current scenario-based research</strong> and examine
      <strong>out-of-ordinary extremes</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To build the <strong>scenario design framework</strong>, we started with
      extensive desk research into various <strong>patterns </strong> and <strong>trends</strong> of <strong>energy citizenship</strong>. This allowed us to
      capture and map the full range of citizen involvement in the energy
      transition. Considering stakeholders&rsquo; insights, we then grouped
      patterns and trends into <em>thematic storylines</em> that highlight both
      <strong>individual</strong>
      and <strong>collective</strong> actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Transformative scenario design </strong>should outline the
      transition to a decarbonized energy system while accounting for potential
      challenges and vulnerabilities humanity might face. To do this, we
      broadened the concept of the
      <strong>Shared Socioeconomic Pathways</strong>
      (SSPs) to capture how various types of &ldquo;<strong>environments</strong
      >&rdquo; may influence the ways citizens engage in the energy transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This structured framework essentially aims to aid the design of transition
      scenarios towards the operationalization and the holistic understanding of
      the decarbonization potential of energy citizenship, also accounting for
      the uncertainty and the dynamic character of events surrounding the
      potential evolution of the future. The novelty of this work lies in the
      flexibility that the developed framework provides to potential users
      towards exploring &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios of the decarbonization
      potential:

          futures, also accounting for future uncertainties and unexpected
          events.

      The concept of energy citizenship, as an emergent concept itself, remains
      undertheorized and the boundaries surrounding it are not strictly defined.
      Varying manifestations of energy citizenship have emerged (and continue to
      emerge) within the energy domain, influenced and shaped by the
      sociopolitical, economic, and cultural specificities found in particular
      cases. To advance the research surrounding energy citizenship with an aim
      to operationalize the concept, we identified the following set of key

      &ldquo;<strong
        >People-centered&rdquo; storylines based on social innovations of energy
        citizenship?</strong
      >
    </h3>
    <p>
      Aiming to bring (energy) citizens at the core of the modeling exercises, <em
        >&ldquo;people-centered&rdquo;</em
      >
      storylines were developed, acting as the driving narratives of the
      simulations. These are a set of qualitative descriptions of the different
      citizen-specific manifestations- either at the <strong>individual</strong>
      or <strong>collective</strong> level- of energy citizenship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each <em>&ldquo;people-centered&rdquo; </em>storyline focuses on a
      specific manifestation of energy citizenship, helping to structure and
      streamline the modeling process. By centering on individual storylines,
      modelers can examine the decarbonization impacts on various scales, while
      also having the flexibility to combine multiple storylines to assess how
      different forms of citizen engagement interact within the energy system.
      For instance, a modeling exercise might explore how increased public
      involvement in climate issues (e.g., political activities) could lead to
      stronger government action and policy measures that support prosumerism
      (e.g., active participation in the energy market).
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, storylines make the design of modeling exercises more
      accessible and engaging for stakeholders, policymakers, and non-experts.
      Their qualitative nature not only facilitates the incorporation of
      stakeholder feedback but also helps to effectively communicate the complex
      assumptions underpinning the modeling exercises, as well as their
      limitations. Moreover, storylines promote interdisciplinary collaboration
      by fostering communication between climate researchers, modelers, and
      experts from a variety of fields such as economics, policy, sociology, and
      technology. This interdisciplinary approach allows diverse insights to be
      integrated into a unified and comprehensive framework.

    <p>
      The <em>&ldquo;future-world&rdquo; </em>narratives are a set of
      qualitative descriptions of potential future evolutions of the
      environments surrounding the different manifestations of energy
      citizenship, e.g., society, geopolitical developments, regulatory
      environment. Different future developments can result in fundamentally
      different states of human society, when considering the capability to
      mitigate and/ or adapt to climate change. The
      <em>&ldquo;future-world&rdquo; </em>narratives are utilized to provide a
      range of contexts to explore such effects, both positive and negative, and
      to assess the overall implications of climate change.

    <p>
      These narratives may consider a broad spectrum of variables that influence
      decarbonization efforts at the local, national, or European levels. By
      capturing a range of possible futures, they help stakeholders envision how
      different factors may interact to shape energy systems and inform the

                    do not differ substantially from historical patterns.
                    Institutions and organizations exhibit slow progress towards
                    sustainable development goals, resulting in persistent income
                    disparities among nations. Environmental systems see modest

    <h2>The ENCLUDE scenario space</h2>
    <p>
      A broad and balanced scenario space is needed in order to implement
      scenario-based research effectively. By crafting diverse sets of
      storylines and narratives that encompass varying degrees of <strong
        >climate</strong
      >- and <strong>energy</strong>-related actions,
      <strong>technological</strong>
      advancements, <strong>societal</strong> shifts, and
      <strong>behavior</strong> adoption rates, a better coverage of future possibilities
      is attained. This offers a nuanced perspective on what the future may hold
      and supports not only preparing for potential challenges, but also illuminating
      pathways toward sustainable and resilient solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, creating a limited and ill-defined scenario space may
      lead to <strong>failing to anticipate</strong> certain developments, or
      <strong>underestimating</strong>
      the complexities of societal transitions which in turn can result in the
      implementation of <strong>insufficient</strong> or
      <strong>misguided policies</strong>
      and <strong>biased decision-making</strong>. For instance, an overly
      optimistic scenario that neglects the challenges of transitioning to a
      renewable energy-based system and assumes rapid global cooperation without
      accounting for geopolitical challenges could result in delayed or
      ineffective policy responses. By anchoring decisions solely on best-case
      scenarios, a misleading perception of security and a failure to adequately
      prepare for contingencies can be created. Similarly, an excessively
      conservative scenario space- one that underestimates the pace of
      technological advancements, policy changes, or societal shifts- can stifle
      innovation and hinder progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      If policymakers are on the side of caution, overly conservative scenario
      space may perpetuate reliance on outdated technologies and impede the
      transition to more sustainable practices. For example, envisioning a
      future where the status quo prevails without accounting for breakthroughs
      in renewable energy or shifts in citizens&rsquo; behavior might discourage
      investments in cutting-edge technologies and sustainable energy sources.
      This can lead to missed opportunities for transformative change and result
      in inadequate preparations for a rapidly evolving climate landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      All things considered, in both cases, the potential ripple effects of
      oversights and misjudges extend to economic repercussions, social
      disruptions, and exacerbation of climate-related vulnerabilities. It is
      imperative, thus, to design a scenario space which encompasses a broad
      spectrum of possible futures, acknowledging uncertainties and embracing
      the depth of complexity of the European landscape, at the local, the
      national, and the transnational level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering these insights, we present the final <strong
        >ENCLUDE scenario space</strong
      >, which, applied to specific case studies, can support the development of
      real-life decarbonization pathways based on social innovations of energy
      citizenship.

    <h2>The ENCLUDE modeling ensemble</h2>
    <p>
      Given the broadness of the <em
        >&ldquo;people-centered&rdquo;
      </em>storylines, a diversity of modeling tools is required to capture the
      impact of the different manifestations of energy citizenship under study.
      For example, active participation in the energy market, or political
      activism would need different modeling tools. In addition, expressions of
      energy citizenship can be traced at a multitude of scales, e.g., at the
      individual, community, national or international level. As a result, a
      model that deals with the required resolution would be needed.
      Furthermore, certain aspects of energy citizenship would call for the
      employment of more than one model. In such cases, we developed several
      interface protocols to facilitate the soft linkage of the models, where
      necessary, and upscale results at the local level to the national level,
      were designed, concerning data transfer and model communication and
      interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The models comprising the ENCLUDE modeling ensemble and used in the
      different project&rsquo;s applications span a range of architectural
      approaches and modeling scopes:
